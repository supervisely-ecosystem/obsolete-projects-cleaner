## Overview

This application allows you to delete unused `Projects` or their `Datasets` in large batches by a given filtering criterion.
  
## How to Run

### All available Workspaces

 - **Checked**: `Projects` or its `Datasets` will be deleted in all available `Workspaces`.
 - **Unchecked**: `Projects` or its `Datasets` will be deleted in selected `Workspace`.

### All available Projects

ℹ️ Only for entity type `Datasets`.

 - **Checked**: `Datasets` will be deleted in all available `Projects` of selected `Workspace`.
 - **Unchecked**: `Datasets` will be deleted in selected `Project` of selected `Workspace`

### Entity type
  - **`Projects`** - You can think of a Project as a superfolder with data and metadata, like classes and tags. Every dataset inside the project will share the same metadata and have the same classes and tags defined on the project-level. [Read more.](https://docs.supervisely.com/data-organization/projects)
  - **`Datasets`** - Dataset is the second most important concept in Supervisely. Here is where your labeled and unlabeled images and images, videos, and so on. There is no more levels: images or videos are directly attached to a dataset. [Read more.](https://docs.supervisely.com/data-organization/projects/datasets)

### Filter criteria

 - **Updated** - specifies the timestamp of the last update, all entities updated before this timestamp will be deleted.
 - **Created** - specifies the creation timestamp, all entities created before this timestamp will be deleted.

    The time stamp is calculated in days, the maximum value that can be set is 720 days.
  
### Method
 - **Delete to Trash Bin** - this method will not delete your data immediately, it will be stored in the recycle bin for 7 days before being completely deleted.
 - **Delete permanently** - this method will immediately delete data. This means that all data will be deleted from the database with no possibility to restore it.


### Launch type
 - **Repetitive Task**
    - **Sleep day(s)** - the number of days the application will wait for the next cleaning iteration after the current one is complete. 
      
      The maximum value that can be set is 180 days.
 - **One-time Task** - run the application only once.
